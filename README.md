## Enhancing Your Zoom Calls with `zoom-virtual-overlay`

The `zoom-virtual-overlay` tool allows you to intercept and manipulate your camera feed before it reaches your Zoom call. This provides you with a myriad of ways to enhance and customize your video output, setting you apart from typical Zoom users. Here are some creative ways to use this tool:

### 1. **Dynamic Backgrounds**:
Instead of using a static image or video as your background, you can now have a live feed of your desktop or any application window. This is particularly useful for:
- Live coding sessions.

### 2. **Annotations and Highlights**:
Overlay annotations, arrows, or highlights on your video in real-time. This can be especially handy for:
- Teachers and educators pointing out features or details.

### 3. **Filters and Effects**:
Apply real-time filters or effects to your video feed. This can include:
- Grayscale or sepia filters.
- Live doodling or drawing.
- Animated effects or transitions.

### 4. **Privacy Features**:
For those concerned with privacy, you can:
- Blur specific parts of your video feed, such as background details.
- Anonymize or mask parts of your environment.
- Display important notifications or alerts without sharing your entire screen.

### 5. **Interactive Elements**:
Integrate interactive elements into your video stream:
- Display live polls or quizzes during a presentation.
- Showcase real-time reactions or feedback.
- Integrate with tools to show live data, metrics, or updates.

### 6. **Branding**:
For professionals looking to maintain brand consistency:
- Overlay your company logo or personal brand.
- Display branded frames or lower thirds with your name and title.

### 7. **Fun and Games**:
For those looking to add a bit of fun to their calls:
